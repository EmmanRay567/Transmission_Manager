# Transmission Manager

This project is a **menu-driven C program** designed to manage car transmission records.  
It was developed to demonstrate core C programming concepts such as structs, file I/O, input validation, and modular program design.

Users can add transmission records, search by ID tag, and save/load data from a file.

---

## Features

- Add new transmission records (ID tag, mileage, failure rate)
- Search for transmissions by ID tag
- Write transmission data to a file
- Read transmission data from a file
- Input validation for tags, mileage, and failure rate
- Menu-driven console interface

---

## Technologies Used

- **C**
- Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`)
- File input/output
- Console-based interface

---

## What I Learned

- Working with structs to store and manage structured data
- Implementing file read/write operations in C
- Validating user input to prevent invalid data
- Designing a modular, menu-based program

---

## Reflection

This project focused on reinforcing C fundamentals rather than building a production system. Future improvements could include dynamic memory management for records, enhanced error handling, and more robust search capabilities.
